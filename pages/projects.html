      <h2>Essential</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Essential is an app that helps people in need find shelter and/or a hot meal throughout the Seattle area.
        <br>
        We designed Essential with two other trends in mind: the number of low-income Americans (those living in households with an annual income of less than $30,000) who own smart phones has doubled in recent years and, increasingly, they rely almost solely on their devices for online access.
        <br>
        Our app provides users with the ability to search for shelter and/or food based on their location. We designed Essential according to mobile-first principles.
